### Aider
- A Git-aware AI coding assistant
- Excels at:
  - Real-time pair programming
  - Git integration with automatic commits
  - Focused, conversation-style coding
  - Quick edits and iterations
  - Working within git repositories
  - Maintaining clean git history

## When to Use Each Tool

### Use Cline for:
1. **Large-scale changes**
   - Refactoring across multiple files
   - Creating new features from scratch
   - Project-wide modifications

2. **Visual Development**
   - Web development tasks requiring browser testing
   - UI/UX changes that need visual verification

3. **System Integration**
   - Tasks requiring external API integration
   - Running development servers
   - Complex build processes

4. **Project Analysis**
   - Understanding large codebases
   - Finding patterns across files
   - Analyzing dependencies

### Use Aider for:
1. **Quick Iterations**
   - Small, focused code changes
   - Bug fixes
   - Code reviews

2. **Git-focused Work**
   - When you want automatic commits
   - Maintaining clean git history
   - Branch-specific changes

3. **Pair Programming**
   - Interactive coding sessions
   - Real-time problem solving
   - Code exploration with conversation

## Effective Workflows

### Sequential Workflow
1. Use Cline for initial setup and major features
2. Switch to Aider for refinements and git management
3. Return to Cline for testing and verification

### Parallel Workflow
1. Use Cline in one window for major changes
2. Keep Aider open in another window for quick edits
3. Coordinate between them based on task needs

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Task Division**
   - Use Cline for complex, multi-file changes
   - Use Aider for focused, git-tracked changes

2. **Git Management**
   - Let Aider handle git commits for small changes
   - Use Cline for major feature implementations
   - Coordinate git operations between tools

3. **Project Organization**
   - Use Cline for project-wide organization
   - Use Aider for file-specific improvements

4. **Testing and Verification**
   - Use Cline's browser automation for visual testing
   - Use Aider for unit test creation and updates

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Cline** for new projects or major features
2. **Switch to Aider** when you need git-tracked iterations
3. **Combine strengths** by using both tools in parallel
4. **Maintain clear boundaries** between each tool's responsibilities
5. **Use version control** effectively with both tools

## Example Workflow

1. **Initial Setup (Cline)**
   - Create project structure
   - Set up basic components
   - Configure build system

2. **Feature Development (Both)**
   - Use Cline for major component creation
   - Use Aider for iterative improvements
   - Coordinate git commits between tools

3. **Testing and Refinement (Both)**
   - Use Cline for integration testing
   - Use Aider for unit test updates
   - Verify changes with both tools

4. **Deployment Preparation (Cline)**
   - Run final tests
   - Build production assets
   - Verify deployment readiness
