## 11.3 Build Ticketing App (Non-MVP)

### Overview
Develop a ticketing system using Gmail labels, integrated with Slack functions, workflows, and triggers. This system will use dion@lookerhelp.com as an alias for dion@wrench.chat on the Slack workspace lookernomicon.slack.com.

### Requirements

1. Gmail Integration:
   - Set up labels in Gmail for ticket status (New, In Progress, Resolved)
   - Create labels for priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
   - Implement labels for issue categories (Technical, Billing, Feature Request)

2. Slack Integration:
   - Use Slack's Gmail integration for notifications
   - Set up Slack workflow to create emails from Slack messages
   - [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/#)

3. Automation:
   - Implement Google Apps Script to:
     - Assign ticket numbers to new emails
     - Set up time-based triggers for ticket escalation
     - Generate reports of ticket status and resolution times

4. Workflow:
   - Incoming email or Slack message creates a new ticket
   - Automatic labeling based on content analysis
   - Slack notification sent to support channel
   - Team members claim tickets with "Assigned to [Name]" label
   - Update labels as ticket progresses

5. Response Management:
   - Use Gmail's canned responses for common issues
   - Implement personalized response suggestions

6. Reporting:
   - Generate Daily Slack Report
   - Generate Priority Alerts

### Implementation Steps

1. Set up Gmail account and configure labels

2. Integrate Gmail with Slack workspace

3. Develop Google Apps Script for automation

4. Create Slack workflows for ticket creation and updates

5. Implement content analysis for automatic labeling (optional: use AI for enhanced analysis)

6. Set up reporting system using Google Sheets

7. Test the system thoroughly with sample tickets

8. Train team on using the new ticketing system

### Considerations

- Ensure GDPR compliance for handling user data
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Consider scalability for future growth
- Regularly review and optimize the ticketing process based on team feedback

Note: This ticketing system is considered a non-MVP feature and should be implemented after core functionalities are in place.

### This script sets up the basic structure for user documentation in GitBook. After running this script:

**1. A "Getting Started" page will be created with basic information about using LookerHelp.**

**2. A "Using Lookernomicon AI Agent" page will be created with instructions on how to use the AI assistant.**

**3. A "Subscription Management" page will be created with information on managing subscriptions.**

### Next steps:

**1. Review the created content in the GitBook web interface.**

**2. Expand on the content for each page, adding more detailed information and examples.**

**3. Create additional documentation pages as needed (e.g., FAQs, troubleshooting guides, advanced features).**

**4. Add images, diagrams, or videos to enhance the documentation.**

**5. Set up a process for regularly reviewing and updating the documentation.**

**6. Consider creating a feedback mechanism for users to suggest improvements or report issues with the documentation.**

**7. Implement a versioning strategy for your documentation to keep it in sync with your product updates.**
