## 1. LookerHelp Development Tools and Environment

LookerHelp leverages a suite of AI-assisted development tools integrated with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to streamline the development process. The primary tools used are Aider, Cline, NotebookLM, and VSCode itself, each offering unique capabilities.

### 1. Aider (Gemini-powered)
Aider is a Git-aware AI coding assistant that excels in:
- Real-time pair programming
- Focused, conversation-style coding
- Quick iterations and bug fixes
- Git-focused work with automatic commits

### 2. Cline (Anthropic-powered)
Cline is a VSCode-integrated AI coding assistant ideal for:
- Large-scale changes across multiple files
- Creating new features from scratch
- Visual development tasks requiring browser testing
- System integration with external APIs

### 3. NotebookLM (Gemini-powered)
NotebookLM assists in:
- Organizing and curating documentation
- Managing scripts and tutorials
- Coordinating testing efforts

### 4. Visual Studio Code
VSCode serves as the central integrated development environment (IDE) for the project:
- Provides a unified interface for all development tasks
- Hosts extensions for Aider and Cline integration
- Offers built-in Git integration for version control
- Supports multiple programming languages and file types
- Enables customization through settings and extensions

## Development Environment Setup

1. Install the latest Python version
2. Install Visual Studio Code
3. Install Aider:

```
python3 -m pip install aider-install --break-system-packages aider-install
```
4. Install VSCode Extensions:
- Aider for VS Code
- Claude Dev

5. Configure .env file with necessary API keys and settings:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here 
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here 
AIDER_MODEL=gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

## Workflow Integration

- Use VSCode as the primary development environment
- Use Cline for initial setup, major features, and project-wide changes
- Switch to Aider for quick iterations, git management, and focused coding sessions
- Leverage NotebookLM for documentation and script management

## Best Practices

1. Clear Task Division:
- Use Cline for complex, multi-file changes
- Use Aider for focused, git-tracked changes
- Use NotebookLM for documentation and testing coordination
- Use VSCode's built-in features for code editing, debugging, and version control

2. Git Management:
- Let Aider handle git commits for small changes
- Use Cline for major feature implementations
- Utilize VSCode's Git integration for repository management

3. Testing and Verification:
- Use Cline's browser automation for visual testing
- Use Aider for unit test creation and updates
- Coordinate testing efforts with NotebookLM
- Leverage VSCode's integrated terminal for running tests
