### This script creates two important documents for your launch preparation:

**1. A comprehensive launch checklist (launch_checklist.md) covering pre-launch, launch day, and post-launch tasks.**

**2. A basic launch timeline (launch_timeline.md) outlining key milestones from final preparations to post-launch review.**

### Next steps:

**1. Review both the launch checklist and timeline, adjusting them to fit your specific needs and schedule.**

**2. Assign team members to different sections of the launch checklist.**

**3. Set up regular meetings to go through the checklist and update the timeline as you progress.**

**4. Create a communication plan for keeping all stakeholders informed during the launch process.**

**5. Prepare contingency plans for potential issues that might arise during launch.**

**6. Consider creating a separate, more detailed technical checklist for your development team.**

**7. Set up a system for tracking and prioritizing user feedback received during and after launch.**

**8. Plan for a post-launch retrospective to gather lessons learned and improve future processes.**
