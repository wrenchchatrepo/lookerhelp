    - Redirect URIs need to be configured
- [x] BigQuery Dataset: Created and configured
- [x] Cloud Storage: Bucket created and verified
- [ ] Firebase Hosting
  * firebase.json configured
  * Environment variables need updating
  * Deployment blocked by pending function URLs

### Stripe Integration Status
- [x] GCS bucket created: lookerhelp-stripe
- [x] Bucket verification in progress (ETA: 6 hours)
- [x] Data Pipeline setup pending verification
- [ ] BigQuery load configuration pending
- [x] Investigating Slack's native Stripe integration as alternative data source

### Documentation (90%)
- [x] Setup instructions
- [x] Deployment guide

## Next Steps

1. Function Redeployment
   - [ ] Update environment variables in .env file
   - [x] BigQuery dataset and table names verified
   - [ ] Redeploy existing OAuth handler
   - [ ] Redeploy existing verification endpoint
   - [ ] Test function endpoints with sample data

2. Frontend Deployment
   - [ ] Update frontend environment variables with new function URLs
   - [ ] Deploy CRA to Firebase Hosting
   - [ ] Configure domain and SSL
   - [ ] Test OAuth with new function endpoints

3. Final Verification
   - [ ] End-to-end OAuth flow
   - [ ] Subscription status in BigQuery
   - [ ] Slack integration check
   - [ ] Monitoring and alerts setup

## Architecture Notes
- Frontend: Static hosting on Firebase (free CDN)
- Backend: Firebase Cloud Functions (free tier)
- Data flow: Stripe -> Cloud Storage -> BigQuery -> Functions
- All components within free tier limits

## Data Flow
1. Payment Processing:
   - User clicks Stripe payment link
   - Payment processed by Stripe
   - Subscription data exported to Cloud Storage

2. Data Integration:
   - Cloud Storage triggers BigQuery load (automated)
   - Stripe data populated in stripe_subscriptions table
   - Real-time subscription status available

3. Verification Flow:
   - OAuth via Firebase Function
   - BigQuery queries for verification
   - Subscription status checked for Slack access

## Tech Stack (All Free Tier)
- Frontend: Create React App on Firebase Hosting
- Backend: Firebase Cloud Functions
- Database: BigQuery
- Storage: Cloud Storage
- Auth: Server-side Google OAuth
- Payments: Stripe Payment Links

## Environment Variables Status
Environment configuration documented and ready for update:
- client/.env.example
  * Google OAuth configuration
  * Function URLs
  * Stripe payment links (pre-configured)
  * OAuth redirect URIs
- functions/.env.example
  * Google OAuth credentials
  * JWT configuration
  * GCP project settings
  * CORS and security settings
  * Function region configuration

## Deployment Status
Ready for initial deployment with:
- Firebase configuration complete
- Cloud Functions setup ready
