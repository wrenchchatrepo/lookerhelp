## Analysis
- Generic "Script error" messages appearing in bundled JavaScript
- Errors occurring at different bundle.js line numbers across two ports
- Likely caused by:
  1. Cross-origin issues
  2. Uncaught JavaScript exceptions
  3. Missing error handling in the application code

## Recommendations
1. Enable source maps in development for better error tracking
2. Add proper error boundaries in React components
3. Check for CORS configuration if making cross-origin requests
4. Review error handling middleware in the application
